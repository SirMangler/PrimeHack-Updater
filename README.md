# PrimeHack-Updater
An Updater/Installer for the [latest PrimeHack versions by Shiiion](https://github.com/shiiion/Ishiiruka).

# What does?
This just checks to see if there's a later update than the installed version (or just installs it if not), copies over Profile data if it exists, and then runs Dolphin.exe
I recommend running this every time you play to ensure the latest updates, or setting this to be the shortcut for PrimeHack.
